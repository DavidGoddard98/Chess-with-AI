# Chess-with-AI
The usual game of Chess that you can play with a friend or against an AI. The AI has two options: Agressive and Random. 

*Currently no UI - perhaps a project for summer*

The game runs in terminal and can be launched by compiling and running Chess.java. You must then simply choose the game mode you would like to play and begin playing your favourite brain game:
